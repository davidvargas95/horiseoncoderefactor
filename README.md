# horiseoncoderefactor

## Description

One key aspect of a successful marketing firm is boosting your clients web presence. The first step though is to have strong Search Engine Optimization yourself. The primary goal that I hope to achieve with this refactor is to provide Horiseon with a website that is more accessible to its users and developers alike. 

### Listed below is a brief explanation on how I strive to achieve this goal: 

* I have reformatted the HTML document to provide proper HTML5 semantics that will:
    * Allow users with disabilities to effectively interpret the web page
    * Create opportunities to condense the CSS file
    * Provide descriptive structure to the HTML that will provide an idea of what the CSS elements will do to that section.

* Redundant CSS elements were condensed into fewer rules to shorten the document

* differing CSS elements were replaced by their parent tag in the stylesheet to create more white space in the CSS document

## Usage

Use these code files to learn about accesibility in both HTML5 and CSS. The comments that I have included in the index.html and style.css will help you to learn how to condense, restructure, and refactor unnecesary coding.
